        Something went wrong, we don't return any specific details because of user's privacy.

        Possible causes:
        - Code invalid or expired
        - User's email isn't verified on the provider
        - An user with the same email, that it's connected to the same provider, but with a different provider ID already exists. In this case we can't link the accounts, because they may be different users.
